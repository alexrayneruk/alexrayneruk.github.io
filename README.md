# DO NOT SEND ANY HARRASMENT TO ANYONE INVOLVED HERE, HARRASMENT GETS NOTHING DONE
## The Start
On the 20th of June 2023, good friend and current Juroze member Skyla, posted a message to the Feziboy discord server concerning their relationship when Sky [^2] was only 16 and Fez into their 20's

> Hey everyone ! I know a lot of you know who I am so I hope that you all are aware that I am doing this for the greater good and safety of everybody here. If you are upset with me after this or do not agree with this, please let me know in DMS as they will be open. Other than that, after this is said and done, I will be leaving this server. When I was 16 and Fez was 20, I was invited to be in a polyamorous relationship with him and Circuit (also an adult). Obviously this would mean that Fez, a 20 yr old grown man had romantic/sexual feelings towards me, a 16 yr old child. Although I declined this offer, some time afterwards another person was added to the relationship. Another 16 yr old. They are still in this relationship, being actively groomed by 2 adults. I sincerely hope that they see the problem with this soon and can heal from the reality of being taken advantage of by people who are grown and should know better. Circuit themselves is also not an upstanding person. Extremely manipulative, guilt trips with very triggering topics (namely su!c!de), and even smaller things such as stealing art and abusing their power as admin and one of Fez’s partners. Everything that has been gathered on them will be in the screenshots shared below. Thank you all for some very fun memories and I hope there can still be peace within this server and within my friendships with people I’ve met through this server.

Attached to this message was a screenshot of a google doc that is now called "The Circuit Files"

Fezi responds to this with only two words.
<img src="TheStart/jesuschrist.png" alt="message from Feziboy reading Jesus Christ. on 20th june 2023 at 16:42" width="200"/>

Around half an hour later Fezi posts a response into general

<img src="TheStart/responseat1715.png" alt="message from Feziboy reading I feel i have to give context to at least some of this because fucking hell this got way out of hand somehow.
A couple of years ago, I met Sky on Instagram, and we became close friends. At some point, they were showing very confusing signals and it felt like they were trying to be in a
relationship with me, and I found that uncomfortable and confusing. I never actually explicitly told Sky I want to be ina relationship with them. I'm not trying to justify my actions
here. I'm just trying to give my perspective, and Skyla already claimed to me that they don't even remember what was happening at that point. This is not an attack. Just context.
I didn't intend on being in a poly relationship with Sky or Circuit, or anyone at all. A lot of the time, I feel I'm not allowed to say no to Circuit because that’s what I'm like with people.
I'm so afraid of being invalidated that I just let people do what they want. But that’s why I'm always stressed out. But I think anything I say from this point is completely invalid
because now I've been labelled a groomer.
I don't want you to automatically side with me because that would be biased. I need people to be extra critical about this because I've tried to stay neutral in everything that's been
happening but obviously that doesr't work, and I'll eventually get into trouble for not taking action.
Fast forward to more recently, I started venting about concerns I had about my relationship with Circuit. Sky was very comforting for this. I felt like all my problems were being
listened to. They went so far to start documenting things on a Google Doc, to help me figure out the best course of action, regarding the awkward spot I've found myself in.
After a bit, it felt as if Sky was looking way beyond the scope of the problem, and it felt like it was no longer about me. Because Sky has been in manipulative situations that look very
similar, if not worse. I tried to correct the suspicions that were straight up misunderstandings, but I was constantly being dismissed because apparently, I'm not able to see things for
what they are. I wasn't trying to tell Sky that they are completely utterly wrong. But I apologise if it did come out that way.
While Circuit does have a lot of personal shit to work through that shouldn't solely be my responsibility, and I shouldn't have to experience their failure to look after the relationship
with me, there were certain details in that Google Doc that weren't even real problems, and mostly just conjecture with no real evidence.

At 18:57 Fezi messages his [^3] now ex-partner Circuit and proceeds to then publish this image alongside another message at 19:19 [^4]

<img src="TheStart/breakup.png" alt="message from Feziboy reading Everything is getting too out of hand and I keep doing nothing about it because I'm scared of
how you'll react.
I've been trying to stay with you but I'm also having to deal with everything that comes with
that. You need to fix yourself and I know you've apologised for where you've gone wrong. And I
know you get scared sometimes. But I've been putting this off for way too long. And I need to.
stop trying to make you happy all the time.
And even the whole thing with ===== has found its way into the public and it's making things really
complicated for me, and I didn't really want to be a part of it. But I was scared of defying what
you wanted. You made me so scared of losing you.
Not only is all of this stressful for me, it's been so stressful for everyone else who cares about
me. I really didn't want to have to say this.
I'm sorry for everything I may have caused in the process. But I think trying to force this
relationship is doing more harm than good. And I think we both know this but we hide things
under the rug a lot and pretend we're ok when clearly we always have some kind of overlooming
conflict.
We have to break up.

 <img src="TheStart/iendedthingswithcircuit.png" alt="message from Feziboy reading I ended things with Circuit. For good.
And I'm trying not to look after their feelings. That's not for me to do. I'm sorry for all the damage that I've done. It's
dumb. It's stupid. And you don't have to justify anything I've done. I don't think I can really make up for it fully. But I
want everyone to know that I'm sorry. Please do give me the space to process this and please don't harass anyone
because that will only make things worse. From this point, I'm going to be focusing on my mental health. Which
means I might not post anything for a long time.
Thank you for sticking around. Bye. @everyone

At 20:07 UTC, Sky messages Circuit, concerned about =====  (who joined Fez and Circut's Poly relationship after Sky left)
 <img src="TheStart/skymsgtocircuit1.png" alt="skysky Today at 3:07 PM
Hey. I know youre aware of what’s
happened in the server. However, I’m
coming to you out of genuine concern for
the safety of =====. I’m not here to accuse or
argue, but I do think it’s fair to ask if you
and ===== have traded sexually explicit
images/videos/etc. Even explicit phone
calls apply to this. Again, not accusing, but
if this is the case, then the proper steps
must be taken because that does count as
child pornography on your devices which is
a crime since you are an adult.
Circuit Today at 3:08 PM
No we have not
skysky Today at 3:09 PM
Ok, thank you. I can only hope you’re being
honest with me.
Circuit Today at 3:11PM
Also the age of consent in our states is 16
so saying that we are together and acting
lovey to each other isn't doing anything
wrong
But I don't plan on doing anything sexual
with ===== until they turn 18 anyways
 on 20th june 2023 at 20:07UTC" width=300 />
<img src="TheStart/skymsgtocircuit2.png" alt="SKYSKY today at 3:12 PM
Even if that were to be the case. There are
moral issues regarding the relationship you
have with =====, even more so because youre
about to be 20. And waiting for them to be
18 only makes you look worse.
Circuit Today at 3:13 PM
Which is why I don't act sexual with =====,
skysky *,°%% Today at 3:15 PM
I’m too tired to go into the moral
implications of being romantically involved
with a minor. I’ve been groomed before and
I hate to say that even besides this I think
you're a genuinely scummy person who
needs to heal a lot of damage that you have
been through yourself and that you’ve
inflicted on others. Especially the child
that youre dating as a soon-to-be 20 yr old.
Do the right thing while you can and let
that kid be a kid.
Circuit Today at 3:16 PM
Thanks....
I already feel like shit because of the
situation with fez....
 on 20th june 2023 at 20:12UTC" width=300 />

Circuit blocked Sky shortly after this.
## The Next Day
On the 21st of june 2023, =====, removed all the messages from the event and posts a message about how Fez did not groom them

<img src="TND/minormessage.png" alt="holy shit its me.
all of this is because of me-
all the pedo stuff-
Why the hell is everyone throwing shit at Fez-...
=====, v Today at 07:14
@Feziboy I want you to understand that I will never be
able to redeem what ive caused. I never ever intended ill
effects. I have been searching for stability and a good
relationship forever now, you were never supposed to be
in this kinda spot, however I met circuit and they
introduced me to you and i figured if I want to be with
Circ- I want to be with you. I found out I really enjoyed
your time. You're smart, you're funny lol, but as ive said
time and time again...there is abuse going on with circuit
and you- and now I suppose its come up strongly
Fez Im saying this publicly because I want others to see
that it wasnt your fault...plus I can garentee you're in no
legal trouble or what not due to multiple laws-
You did not groom me, and I dont truly belive that you
really ‘loved me’. I dont mean this harmfully but I mean it
in honesty.
lam sorry. I wont be able to make up for this- and while
sorry is nearly meaningless...its currently- the best I can
give.
Im happy you're out of the situation with circuit, and im
willing to help fight any accusations of you being a
groomer.
God damn im so fucking sorry man...you're to good of a
person to have a bullshit label like that...
 on 21th june 2023 at 07:14UTC" width=300 />

Fezi posts a message about not harassing Circuit about their actions later that night

<img src="TND/feziharass.png" alt="Feziboy Today at 20:44
Can you quit the super unhelpful harassment? I don't mean to be a party pooper here but you complain about Circ
being childish when you are now being childish af. At least make it constructive... It's a waste of time.
Circuit is a lot more complicated than they may seem and there are many things you don't see behind the curtains
in terms of the abuse they have to deal with literally every single day in person, as well as the debilitating trauma,
and now the breakup. And if this doesn't deter you, then you're just not allowing them to learn or grow, which
means you don't want growth. You want Circuit to become bitter. You want something to shit on just make yourself
feel good. So now you are part of the problem. Please stop harassing Circuit before you accidentally make things
worse... @everyone

Questbound (Fay) had messaged Fezi ealier asking "do you ever see yourself comming back" and Fez responded

<img src="TND/qbvsfezi.png" alt="Feziboy Today at 9:22 AM
I want to but I feel I'm not allowed to
I never have bad intentions and I'm always so fixated on
what others want, and somehow that gets me into
trouble, and I get manipulated a lot, and Sky was so
quick to push a negative light on me and refused to
listen to any reasoning, and I always want to make sure
everyone is safe at all times which means I protect
everyone, and that somehow will find a way to get me
into trouble. I would never actually allow harm to be
caused to anyone. There was no harm. But it looked
really bad because Sky was clearly upset and framed it
in a really shitty way. Everything I ever said was just an
attempt to be inclusive but it's not because of anything I
personally want. I just enjoy everyone's happiness. But at
this point, I guess it sounds like I'm talking out of my ass.
So take it or leave it I guess. This has been giving me
really really long panic attacks. Because idk who tf
trusts me and idk who tf cares.
qb Today at 2:31PM
Then I believe a better question is why did you support
circuits predatory behavior?
From the screenshot Sky sent it made it sound like you
were the one who had initial feels for sky

 After this Aaron Matthews messages Fez calling him out for lack of accountability

Aaron Matthews Today at 20:55
you are showing a disgusting lack of
accountability fez and honestly i can’t
believe it from you. that announcement
is absolutely disgusting and is showing
that despite ALL of this backlash and
everything said yesterday, you’re still
both incapable of taking accountability
for both of ur parts in this incredibly
damaging and predatory behaviour. for
ONCE stop pushing the blame off of
yourself and just accept that, yes you
and circuit did something bad and
you're going to receive criticism for it,
the complete lack of accountability
and rejection of this criticism in the
first place is what makes the fire
continue to burn because it’s obvious
you're just not thinking about it without
ur own feelings first.

Fezi then responds

<img src="TND/fezresponsetoaaron.png" alt="
Feziboy Today at 21:54
I wasn't trying to imply that I'm avoiding anything. What I'm telling you is that this isn't gonna resolve instantly. I can see you are obviously upset and I do respect your willingness to call out
the bullshit you see. However. I think you're trying to get instant closure and the harassment is making it really tricky for Circ to just accept defeat. I'm trying to allow Circuit to really take in
the information and process everything that has happened. And I understand you're gonna wanna respond with an emotional response but what I'm trying to get at is the harassment
distracts from the actual processing because it causes everyone to focus on the conflict itself. I don't want to permanently damage our friendship and it's really overwhelming to try to
respond to everything while I've been in meltdown mode because that's what happens when a lot of information enters my brain too quickly and then people get mad at me for it. You're not
doing anything inherently wrong but I can't even think properly rn and I need time to figure out what needs to happen. I suppose it'll be hard for you to process that but I basically described
autism which makes it really really hard for me to understand other people's intentions and social queues which is why I'm easily manipulated and it's why the thing with Skyla happened
which I already took accountability for

And also a note to whoever is reading this and you have autism. NEVER PULL THE AUTISM CARD IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS YOU CANNOT USE IT IN THIS SITUATION

Aaron Matthews Today at 22:23
you're still continuing to deflect eveything. you cant just say youre taking accountability and then continue to blame it on ur autism and skyla. I'm not trying to get instant closure theres no
closure to be had here fez. what i do want is for u to stop fucking deflecting it as u just did AGAIN multiple times in that message. Circ doenst need to accept defeat by them rejecting it is
showing that u guys DO NOT CARE about the ACTUAL issue and u ONLY care about the backlash. | also dont like that ur calling it harassment implying that we're just being big meanies.
you're not upset about the situation, you're upset that u got caught and called out. no one has ANY sympathy for a groomer and u should stop acting like they deserve it.
instead of responding out of ur own hurt feelings take time to actually assess whats going on
your autism is not an excuse for this, u cant continue to justify it to yourself. you need to seriously reevaluate ur morals.

 2 days later, Fez shares this conversation with Aaron


<img src="AC/2daysl8r.png" alt="
Circuit today at 02:24
Fez I'm legit about to shove a gun in my mouth because I'm being spammed nonstop with harassment
Feziboy today at 02:08
I'm not attacking you, but I've been reflecting a lot, and I think the reason people are so worked up about this is because they are
simply looking out for any possibility of some kind of power dynamic that could lead to serious psychological effects, which means
they're doing it out of genuine love and empathy for someone who is vulnerable.
Ok, before I get to the next part, I just need you to really breathe slowly and try to relax.
Now, technically, you are legally in the green if you want to have the relationship with ==== And maybe ==== is okay with it and
there's no immediate damage done. But there's no reason ==== would know better. Between ===  and I, there’s a 5-year age gap. And
a lot of things can happen within 5 years, let alone 4. 'm not attacking you. I promise.
So, when you introduced me to.=== I was very uncomfortable. And I think you know that. But I didn't want to upset you because
you'd already threatened to leave me or off yourself on multiple occasions and often made me feel guilty for having thoughts or
opinions that happened to defy yours. And I know I can be a pain sometimes. This established a really tricky dynamic.
I've expressed to- throughout the few months of knowing === . how it made me so uncomfortable, and how it felt so wrong ===
can confirm this, and I can send screenshots if you need.
Personally, I'm not entirely sure why you held onto it so much, despite how I was going to feel as a result, but you didn’t like me
questioning you and I didn’t want to feel like shit, so I tried to ignore it and move on. But I always had a feeling it would eventually
become a whole thing. I just didn't know when.
I think you should think about this for a bit. I acknowledge it's not how you saw it. But I think there are some things you need to
reassess before you act. But I can't control how you handle it.

## Fezi announces a new rule and its stupid as fuck

In the evening, Fezi creates a new role essentially banning minors from the server and requiring  verification.

<img src="NewRules/ruleupdate.png" alt="Feziboy Yesterday at 23:52
RULE UPDATE!! RULE UPDATE!! RULE UPDATE!!
Due to the recent controversies that got way out of hand, we collectively decided to enforce a new rule. For the
sole purpose of protecting those who are underage...
You must be 18+ to use this server!!
INSTRUCTIONS:
To verify, send proof of age and a picture of yourself in admin DMs and an admin will get back to you within 24
hours.
Any evidence that you are underage will result in a permanent ban.
@everyone (edited)
 on 23rd june 2023 at 23:52UTC" width=500 />

For those who had not verified yet, the server looked like this

<img src="NewRules/lockdown.png" alt="A screenshot of a discord server's (fezicord) channel list. The only channels avaliable are rules, self-role, announcements, invite-link, youtube and livestreams" width=100 />

A new general chat is created for the server

Fez states that he had to remove all minors from the server and says that people who care about his content would follow the new rules

<img src="NewRules/publicstate.png" alt="Feziboy 23/06/2023 06:31
I had to essentially cleanse this server of all the kids which does make it seem very quiet
If people care about my content enough, I'm sure they'll go along with it
But it's gonna be a pretty slow process
On the flip side, it's basically impossible for people to immediately join and spam
I had to say goodbye to a moderator who was under 18
Safe to say, he was not happy, but it is what it is"
 width=500 />

At this point most of the server's channels are still privated to 18+ however general is still open to anyone who joins

<img src="NewRules/server.png" alt="a list of discord channels, a majority of them being locked"
 width=200 />

Fezi also adds to this in #rules asking for proof of age and a photo.

someone you don't already talk
to is just too shy to admit it
Now, how you go about figuring
that out, I have no idea

<img src="NewRules/instadm2.png" alt="Sky:
Replied to Fez
is it you 
there i did it
ez pz
Fez:
And I feel it's necessary for me
to mention, I'm very much
attracted to Circuit first and
foremost, and anything else is
just a result of unmet needs like
affection. It'd also be far easier if
the person who liked you like
that were in the same freakin
piece of land as you!!
Sky:
self direction is a funny concept
Fez:
I will travel to America with the
sole purpose of murdering you
if you don't process what I'm
trying to reassure you
LMFAO I AM
im just making a funny
Fez:
Alright, good
"  width=300 /> [^5]

Fezi goes on to say that he only said he was attracted to help her due to her "vulnerability" at the time

<img src="NewRules/instadm3.png" alt="Feziboy: I'm not proud of how I went about that
But denial is very uncomfortable, and I want to be super honest with you
Sky was in a vulnerable place and the implication that I was attracted to her was just so irrational and I feel weird thinking
about how easily that happened
Even if I never intended on initiating anything, and even if I was trying to help her navigate relationships, the implication
that I was attracted to her could easily have made things bad, and I've been ashamed to talk about it ever since"
 width=500 />

Fez had also admitted before-hand that he would of had a sexual relationship with Sky if it wasn't for Circuit and the fact Sky was under 18 [^6]

<img src="NewRules/fezadmits.png" alt="Gru from dispicable me Today at 00:43
he literally had told me that he had a sexual (key word SEXUAL) attraction towards me but that cant be “proved”
bc it was on a fucking call
Gru from dispicable me Today at 00:46
like i remember clear as fuckin day this man insinuated to me on call that he had to hold back from engaging in
sexual relations w me bc of circuit and bc i was a minor"
 width=500 />[^7] [^11]


Fezi claims that the reason the new rule have been implemented is due to him not wanting this to happen again.

 <img src="NewRules/notagain.png" alt="Feziboy  Today at 12:46
But yeah, I just don't want things like that to happen again, so I figured it's easier to regulate that by making sure
people can prove they are 18+ to interact with everyone here (edited)"
 width=500 />

 > however this could easily not happen again IF YOU JUST DONT TRY TO DATE CHILDREN ITS REALLY NOT THAT HARD GUYS

later on, the entire server gets purged and reset 

## Apology

On the 2nd of July 2023, (around 9 days since the last event) this video is uploaded to the Feziboy youtube channel

<video width="320" height="" controls>
  <source src="apology/apology.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Alex responds to this saying that Fezi definitely did not learn as he had then dated another 16 year old after this interaction

 <img src="apology/AlexResponse.png" alt="@LilBama 1 day ago
this situation was so much more than just those instagram dms. you make it out to be a mistake you made once and that
but in reality its so much more than that fez. You have admitted to invited them to your relationship and you completely
left out the others involved in this. Fez you are portraying this as not a big deal and i made a mistake once when i was 20
but since you have since dated a 16 year old post you clearly haven't learned. You have addressed this publicly now
outside of discord but have left out so many details. This is a complex situation fez I wish you would treat it like one.
@Feziboy 1 day ago
It is a complex situation. I wanted to address a very specific thing I completely overlooked, but I planned on making
an in-depth breakdown of everything that went down, which is taking a while to finish. The video I published here
was recorded about a week ago and I knew there was so much more to cover and initially I forgot that I scheduled
this to publish in my other channel. And then I didn't want it to seem like I was hiding it from the main audience so I
uploaded it here instead. Point is, I know and I'm working on it.
My partner at the time tried to date a 16 year old and also date me at the same time. I didn't want to be a part of that
but I also didn't want to leave immediately. Usually I'd be tempted to make excuses around that but I can see how
enabling that was.
When I said I invited Skyla to the relationship, I was panicking to protect Circuit's reputation. Whether that actually
happened or not, I'm not sure. But I remember there being a very strange uncomfortable dynamic between us that I
failed to regulate and the evidence here was the only thing I could find that was loosely related to that.
People keep asking questions about it and it's really tricky to try to explain it to like 50 people on separate occasions
so I genuinely have been planning a better video but it's just taking a while to finish it and make sure I get it right and
accurate.
I'm sorry this whole thing has ruined our friendship. But, like I said in this video, I absolutely understand if you don't
want to have anything to do with me. I have to live with my failure to communicate boundaries to important people
in my life. I have to live with my hesitation to really put my foot down because it's not like I'm completely unaware of
when things are questionable. My problem is I'm so scared of conflict that I often don't even do anything about
situations that are really bad.
I do appreciate you leaving this in the comments though because it's made it crystal clear that there are so many
layers to this that have polarised people's opinions of me, and I want to make sure people know the facts before
they arrive on any conclusion. Because it's upsetting when people label me things that I personally find disgusting.
I'm trying to be better at taking action. I'm working on it."
 width=500 /> [^7]

Fezi messages this to Aaron about how Cicuit affected him [^8]

 <img src="apology/fez2aaron1.png" alt="Feziboy Yesterday at 22:02
Because of Circuit. I fuckin lost so
much progress. My mental health is
very rapidly declining. I keep getting
drunk to try to cope. I have panic
attacks and breakdowns all the time. It
feels like everybody fucking hates me.
Because of ripoff, fuckin Oliver Tree
fans think I'm a pedo. I care about my
reputation but the moment I say that,
I'm fucking selfish. Apaprently, I just
fuck everything up and I'm just sooo
pathetic. According to questy.
Everything is a wrong answer. Fuck
everything. I have every right to be
angry right now and I'm so fucking tired
of trying to please everyone. I'm sorry if
this comes off as combative towards
you specifically. I just don't know who
to turn to anymore."
 width=300 /> [^9]


On the 19th, Fez messages Aaron about how the situation has affected him

 <img src="apology/fezbelike.png" alt="Feziboy Today at 22:15
I really hate that Skyla actually thinks I'm a pedo. Either that or she's trying to push a narrative out of some sort of pettiness. I'm not a fucking pedo. I get so angry every time someone
mentions Skyla. On the day that server explosion happened, she was getting very involved with my relationship with Circuit and she got upset when I told her to slow down because it's not
her relationship. It was mine. Then she fucking turned on me and made sure I looked really bad, without actually trying to unpack everything verbally with me first. And I started saying
things out of just pure emotional outbursts like ''I'M A PIECE OF SHIT'' because I was just really fucking upset at Skyla for just not taking me seriously at all anymore. That is what happened.
And now I feel like people are monitoring my behaviour 24/7 and I feel like I can't upload what I want anymore. And I hesitate to say things to you or any of the others because I'm pretty sure
I'll come off as manipulative. But occassionally, I just cna't stop thinking about it and I feel I need to epxress my frustration. But I don't think it will do anything.
" /> 


On the 25th, Fez makes another request for people to stop calling him a pedo

<img src="apology/fezlore.png" alt="Feziboy Yesterday at 11:29PM
I need to make this clear. I did NOT date a minor
My intention was to date my adult partner. We broke up.
The situation is far more nuanced than this but I wanted to apologise for my own mistake [regarding Skyla] first and foremost. But that’s a separate problem
and I've made a video covering it. I can see now the false allegations have gone out of control, and I think it's becoming a distraction. I have to address it
publicly.
About 3 months ago or so, while we were still in a relationship, my partner introduced someone to me. I didn't know their age immediately and weld talked
about polyamorous relationships in the past. My partner then revealed this mysterious person was actually 16 years old. I expressed a lot of discomfort.
They often mentioned the Romeo and Juliet act, which I didn't really understand at the time, but they'd use that to legally justify it. I've looked into it since,
and my partner seems to fall perfectly into the grey area. But, remember, I'm no expert.
I still didn't want to date this 16 year old. But at this point, they'd managed to convince me it was legally ok for them to date. So it quickly became a 2-way
dynamic. An open relationship. They would date each other. And the adult would date me independently.
My partner was incredibly manipulative at the worst of times. I was under their control. I wanted to make everyone happy and my partner had the tendency
to gaslight me when I posed some sort of intellectual threat. if you knew how much money I'd spent on them just to avoid conflict...
I've age-restricted the server. So now you have to DM an admin with proof of age before you are allowed to use it freely. And any evidence you lied will result in
a permanent ban. This is solely to protect minors. Because I really don't want this kind of thing to happen again.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to be labelled with something I find so disturbing to think about. It hurts. I'm not a pedo."

This was reposted into the Circuit Files (as it was public edit at the time)

>But onna fr note I just wish he'd stop making an announcement and just dip from the internet for a bit for his mental health and everyone involved in the situation him having an announcement every other day isn't helping anything and it's actively creating more discourse

around a month later, (we are unsure of the date of the event) the server is deleted.


the situation stayed calm for around 7 months or so apart from the odd message in Oliver Tree's discord... until....


## 2024 FEZI EXPOSURE 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO

On the 17th March 2024, Alex posts this tiktok replying to one of Fezi's old comments

Fezi responds trying to defend himself



 <img src="FE2EB/fezicomments1.png" alt="Feziboy
that's fucked up. please take this down. my ex dated a minor. look into how abusive relationships work. pls. this makes me so uncomfortable. not that you fucking care. you clearly don't fucking care.
I never liked kids. I made dumb decisions to protect my abusive ex and, as an autistic conflict avoidant person, I was severely taken advantage of.
it's upsetting that a lot of people still have such an incorrect perception of me. it's affecting how I deal with my current relationship and anyone I interact with now. 
I'm glad I broke up with my ex. i've been dating a man older than me and I've been so much happier. but this disgusting label has been following me around and it sends me into panic attacks too often.
it's literally trauma.
Alex: 
Womp womp just don’t be into kids it's that easy

“My ex dated a minor” while you were talking about sexually being attracted to sky when she was 16
Feziboy
BUTI WASN'T ATTRACTED TO HERI! I WAS SAYING ANYTHING TO PROTECT MY ABUSER, THIS HAS BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH
I DON'T LIKE KIDS FFS, GET THAT OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND, IT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING, I AM SO DONE
she came on to me and I shut it down, you are literally ying - I wanted her to stil have hope for a relationship with someone else but I am literally not sexvally attracted to women.

Oh so now we're lying??? Please lie more I promise the mountain of screenshots we have won't change babes

The next day, Fezi messages Fay with this message

>Skyla had a lot of problems with relationships and self image and, because I feel the need to make people happy all the time, it's landed me into a lot of terrible situations I regret to this day, and I've been trying to accept that I can't change the past, I tried to apologise like this before and move on with my life instead agonising about tis all the time. 
>
>She turned to me because I have the tendency to comfort those in distress, so much so that I contradict my actual beliefs and values, just to make everyone happy.
>
>She came to me saying no one finds her attractive, I didn't want her to think she was ugly, so I told her she is attractive. I am not attracted to her, but people perceiving themselves as ugly upsets me. It was horrible attempt and it hurts to think about the fact that actually happened. I would say anything just to give her the sense that she is worthy.
>
>I understand the overall implication was wrong and I wasn't thinking about the overall effect of that statement. I am not sexually or romantically attracted to her, I was just a friend trying to comfort another friend in a way that was incredibly detached from reality.
>
>My intentions were always to make everyone happy and I didn't always have the best method of doing so and I regret that every day, but my intentions were always pure. I know I can't prove that. But I know that's the case and it upsets me that I've caused this amount of damage and it's been haunting me with intrusive thoughts of people thinking I'm attracted to minors when I'm not
>
>I literally avoid interacting with kids in any way because of this, and I don't hate the way I interacted with her and I'm now understandably perceived as a threat, and I've become very isolated as a result.
>
>I always regret how I went about dealing with Skyla and tell this to my close friends whenever it comes up. It pains me that people see me as a predator of sorts and I understand why people see me
that way and are upset about my
actions. I'm not happy with me. I
feel terrible whenever anyone
brings it up. I never want to cause
conflict to anyone and I'm sorry
for my shitty behaviour.

>I just need you to understand, I
am not attracted to minors. That
is disgusting in every sense. But
no matter what I do, I can't
change people's minds about me
and, as I'm getting to the end of
writing this, I want to come to
terms with that.

On the 28th, Sky posts this TikTok explaining everything

<video width="320" height="" controls>
  <source src="FE2EB/tiktok_mcskittlezzz_7351560482270088490.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

We then discover that Fezi has a new discord server (created 25th Feburary at 20:30)

**the next images are taken from a [chat export](feziserv28/FeziCord%20-%20Text%20Channels%20-%20💬general%20[1211444875984379964]%20(after%202024-03-28).html) I created shortly before starting this document**

Fezi says that the reason he isn't allowed in Oliver Tree servers is due to "misinformation"


 <img src="FE2EB/treecord.png" alt="==
like wha??
Feziboy 
It's because someone who used to own TreeCord spread misinformation about a very sensitive issue that eventually lead to me deleting my server
Ever since, I get banned as soon as I try to join those servers
It's super frustrating
person:
wait wha happened (if you're comfortable ofc)
Feziboy 
It has a lot to do with my ex, who tried to date a minor and get me involved
person: 
i saw a tiktok about it earlier today actually they had like screenshots and stuff but idk if its real
Feziboy 
There are 2 issues sort of tied into 1 and I imagine whatever screenshots someone might have uploaded were likely taken out of context idk
But the whole thing puts me into panic mode whenever anyone brings it up"/> 

In the archive server we are also told about Circuit and how weird they are  
 <img src="FE2EB/rob.png" alt="btw I met the 16 in their poly relationship and circuit said some very sexual things to them while in call with me. EA: ''I wanna ---- your ---.'' LIKE WHAT!?!?!?"
  /> [^6]

Sky joins the discord and starts calling Fez out again

<img src="FE2EB/skyin.png" alt="
skysky 29/03/2024 00:09
yeah i mean its not a horrible apology like every other one youve made before, but you keep flip flopping between almost getting the point and completely dodging it
also continuously blaming me
as if i wasnt a child"
  />

We are also told (in the TikTok) and the discord that Circuit is continually attempting to message Sky and snap them.
<img src="FE2EB/circuit.png" alt="skysky 29/03/2024 00:19
do u remember that? probably not :(
also tell circuit to stop hitting on me via snapchat before i send the authorities to do a wellness check on them bc they have free access to guns and are incredibly mentally unstable"
  />

Fezi attempted to use the conversation with Fay to get out of it. Then Fay shares her full response

  <img src="FE2EB/faytofez.png" alt="Fay:
So I’m gonna be real
This actually makes a lot of sense
and is quite respectable
Why didn't you say this to begin
with?
Also why go as far as to invite sky
into the relationship and still
express having sexual feelings
twords her?
Making her feel confident is one
thing but wouldn't you say that’s
pushing it way to far?
Fez:
absolutely
Fay:
So would say there was at least
SOME feelings for her there at
the time?"

  <img src="FE2EB/faytofez2.png" alt="Fay 29/03/2024 00:27
Cropping my messeges for less context is crazy gang"
  width=300/>

>remember when fez locked their old server to 18+ to protect minors like who was he protecting them from?? himself?? the only reason that happened is cos fez was called out

Fez keeps on trying to play the victim

  <img src="FE2EB/victimplaya.png" alt="
Feziboy 29/03/2024 00:50
Look, many people who know me understand that the things that I experience occur as a result of me caring about other people's situations more than my own and I get really upset and scared when people think I'm a threat because I'm not a threat. I don't understand why people might not care about me and you're allowed to not care about my feelings but I still don't understand because I spend so much energy looking out of other people and that's why I have such close friends in the first place. People that understand me outside of the internet."
  />

  <img src="FE2EB/unprod.png" alt="
Feziboy 29/03/2024 00:51
This conversation is painfully unproductive.
litterally a cat 
grooming is also pretty unproductive ngl"
  width=300/>

## The rest of the server gets involved (YAY)


So bama does the genius thing and pings everyone

  <img src="restofsrv/bamabased.png" alt="
Lil Bama 29/03/2024 00:53
@everyone guys your favourite tiktok musician who cannot mix is a pedophile!!"
  width=500/>

A few people try to defend him but we are able to shut them down easily
  <img src="restofsrv/person.png" alt="person 29/03/2024 00:55
I know the man personally and I can tell you for a fact he is not
I know actual pedophiles, people who have done shitty things to kids and fez is would never
I know the man personally and I can tell you for a fact he is not
Lil Bama
explain this screenshot from fez"
  width=500/>

The screen shot is the insta dms that Fez admitted to being attracted to Sky

For some reason when another member pings everyone alongside us, the head mod stops them

  <img src="restofsrv/nottag.png" alt="== 29/03/2024 01:01
I'm very sorry but you can not tag everyone it is rude to everyone we don't need more notifications
So please don't do it again this is coming from the head staff"
  width=500/>

this person also asks people to stop calling Fez a pedo because "its in the past"

  <img src="restofsrv/rules.png" alt="
= 29/03/2024 01:22
It's not nice to call people a pedophile for something that happened awhile ago just keep it in the past your acting like he's going to just see kids and do something with them you guys are very rude when feziboy is offline and I respect feziboy don't be being rude it's rule number 2"
  />

This person is also 15 so probably dosen't know the full extent of what happened as Fezi did purge the previous server.


Sky and Alex were both banned shortly after.

Followed by Fay and myself

> never fucking delete this un.

## Oliver Tree fans come to the rescue

For those unaware, Fezi was a member of the Oliver Tree community and his music style is very much similar to Oliver. He frequently uses leaked stems and demo songs and proceeded to release them (which is not only illegal [^10] but also really wrong)

Most people in the community already knew already about what happened last time but we decided to make it more public.

On the 29th. Sky posted a discord message into Oliver Tree's discord sharing the TikTok video 


  <img src="OT/sky.png" alt="
skysky — 29/03/2024 03:21
hey guys ik we all hate feziboy but most of you dont rlly know why ! im here to tell you that youre in luck bc im the first person they preyed on and i made a video abt it :3
https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTLrP8s7y/
have fun, yall ! 💋"
  />

We also get confirmation that Oliver does not own the "Mr. Tree" spotify account

  <img src="OT/mtree.png" alt="
= — 29/03/2024 03:29
It really is fuck feziboy but I should clarify that oliver has no control over the Mr tree Spotify as that Spotify is ran by some random fan who uploaded Oliver’s old shit back in 2020
Image of Sky's comment
But yeah I need to save that video because on the Oliver subreddit you get the occasional dumbass being like “what’s this who’s feziboy” and I have to keep on removing on the grounds of him being a pedophile"
  />

The mods offer to pin Sky's post on Reddit and she does

  <img src="OT/pin.png" alt="
= — 29/03/2024 03:37
If you really feel like it please post it on the subreddit and I’ll pin it
We haven’t seen a feziboy post in a while but it’s good to just get the word out"
